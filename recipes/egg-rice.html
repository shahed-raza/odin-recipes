        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>To make egg rice, start by cooking 2 cups of rice and letting it cool so the grains remain separate;
            heat oil or butter in a pan, add finely chopped onions and sauté until translucent, then add ginger-garlic
            paste and green chilies and cook until fragrant. Push the onions to the side, crack in 3-4 eggs, season with
            salt and pepper, scramble them lightly, then mix with the onions. Add vegetables like carrots, beans,
            or capsicum if desired and stir-fry briefly, then add the cooked rice along with soy sauce (or salt to taste)
            and a pinch of black pepper, mixing gently on high heat so the rice doesn't break. Finish with spring onions
            or coriander leaves, adjust seasoning, and serve hot on its own or with a side of chili sauce or raita.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>To make chicken biryani, begin by marinating 1 kg bone-in chicken with 1 cup yogurt,
            ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, biryani masala, lemon juice, salt,
            and a little oil for at least one hour; meanwhile soak 2 cups basmati rice for 30 minutes,
            then boil it in plenty of water with salt and whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon)
            until the rice is about 70% cooked and drain it. In a heavy pot, heat ghee or oil and fry thinly
            sliced onions until golden, add green chilies and ginger-garlic paste, then tomatoes and cook 
            until soft and aromatic; add the marinated chicken and cook until it is partially done and the 
            masala thickens. Lower the heat and layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken, topping
            it with chopped mint, coriander, fried onions, and saffron milk (or rose water), then cover tightly
            and cook on very low heat (dum) for about 20-25 minutes until the chicken is tender and the rice is
            fully cooked, rest for a few minutes, gently fluff, and serve hot with raita and lemon wedges.</p>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>To prepare daddo-janam (curd rice) with mash daal, start by cooking soft rice and letting it cool slightly,
            then mix it with fresh curd (yogurt), a little salt, and a splash of milk to get a creamy consistency.
            For the mash daal, pressure-cook moong daal or mash daal with turmeric and salt until very soft, then
            mash it well; heat a little oil or ghee, add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, dried red chilies, curry leaves,
            and a pinch of hing, and pour this tempering over the mashed daal, mixing gently. Serve the curd rice warm
            or at room temperature, topped with the mash daal, and accompany it with pickle, green chilies, or a drizzle
            of ghee for a comforting, traditional meal.</p>
